# 珍字集覽

A community evidence wiki for characters and glyphs. Anyone can create a record with a source image and view the collection.

A record keeps a character or glyph as a person encountered it, with a source image and optional IDS. The collection gathers them in one place for discovering and sharing new characters, and keeps the evidence for analysis and IRG suggestions.

## Local development

Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/), then run:

```sh
bun install
bun run db:local
bun run preview
```

The local D1 database is stored in Wrangler's local state. To run the checks:

```sh
bun run test
bun run check
bun run build
```

The Cloudflare configuration contains a placeholder D1 ID. Provision a database and configure its binding before using a separate environment.

## Visibility

Apply the D1 migrations before serving code that reads visibility. Drain old application instances before hiding entries, since older readers do not filter them. Hiding an entry cannot retract responses already in flight or content already loaded or cached by a client.

## JSON export

`GET /export.json` returns visible records in ascending id order with `version: 1`. Read `next` and request `?after=<next>` until it is null. Pages default to 100 records; `limit` accepts 1 to 200. Hidden records are excluded and responses are not cached.

```sh
curl 'https://example.org/export.json?limit=200'
curl 'https://example.org/export.json?limit=200&after=200'
```

Each record contains its id, script, IDS, description, place, source URL, title, author, publisher, year, page, note and creation time. Images and related-character comparisons are not included.

## Continuous integration

GitHub Actions runs `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and `bun run build` for pull requests and pushes to `main`.

## Limitations

This is a local prototype, not ready for public operation. It has no moderation, abuse prevention, rate limiting, editing, deletion or contributor accounts. The collection page lists 20 records at a time; export pages use the cursor described above.
