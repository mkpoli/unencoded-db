# 珍字集覽

A community evidence wiki for characters and glyphs. Anyone can create or revise a record with a source image and view its revision history.

A record keeps a character or glyph as a person encountered it, with a source image and optional IDS. The collection gathers them in one place for discovering and sharing new characters, and keeps the evidence for analysis and IRG suggestions.

## Local development

Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/), then run:

```sh
bun install
bun run db:local
bun run preview
```

The local D1 database is stored in Wrangler's local state. To run the checks:

```sh
bun run test
bun run check
bun run build
```

The Cloudflare configuration contains a placeholder D1 ID. Provision a database and configure its binding before using a separate environment.


## Glyph Atlas sign-in

Sign-in is optional. Configure `ATLAS_ISSUER`, `ATLAS_CLIENT_ID`, `ATLAS_CLIENT_SECRET` and `ATLAS_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` as worker secrets or bindings, and register the exact callback URL `<ATLAS_PUBLIC_ORIGIN>/auth/callback` with the provider. The public origin must match the request origin exactly and use HTTPS, except for loopback HTTP in local development. Apply all D1 migrations before enabling the feature. The issuer and discovery endpoints must use HTTPS; discovered endpoints must share the issuer's origin. The provider must support authorization code flow, PKCE S256, client secret basic authentication and RS256 ID tokens. A token's issued-at time must be within ten minutes. No credentials are included in this repository.

Sign-in requires an anonymous contributor session. Adding evidence creates one; otherwise, select “Sign in with Glyph Atlas” and then “Continue to Glyph Atlas”. Sign-in links the contributor to the verified issuer and subject. If that identity already exists, the anonymous person is mapped to the existing person; historical entry creator IDs stay unchanged. Signing out revokes the current session. Changing to another Glyph Atlas account requires signing out first.

The protocol follows [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html), [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html), and [RFC 7636: PKCE](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636).

## Visibility

Apply the D1 migrations before serving code that reads visibility. Drain old application instances before hiding entries, since older readers do not filter them. Hiding an entry cannot retract responses already in flight or content already loaded or cached by a client.

## Revision rollout

The revision migration copies existing records in one statement; its time and storage costs grow with the database. Pause submissions and drain older writers before migrating, and rehearse the migration against a representative copy. Evidence updates that omit the revision step fail after migration. Drain editors that do not check the visibility generation before changing visibility; they can otherwise submit forms opened before a hide and restore.

## Continuous integration

GitHub Actions runs `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and `bun run build` for pull requests and pushes to `main`.

## Limitations

This is a local prototype without moderation, abuse prevention, rate limiting or deletion. Pagination lists 20 records at a time. Provider availability and the permitted endpoint layout have not been verified against a live Glyph Atlas deployment. Discovery and keys are fetched on each sign-in; each provider request has a five-second deadline and a 128 KiB response limit. The provider controls the identity assertions it issues.

Sessions expire after 365 days. Clearing an anonymous cookie loses its link to future contributions. Simultaneous first submissions or sign-in preparations can create separate anonymous identities, with only one cookie retained by the browser. If concurrent preparations establish different session families, signing out of one family cannot revoke an in-flight callback bound to the other; avoid concurrent preparation tabs. Expired flows and revoked sessions are not cleaned up automatically. Attribution merges are stored as person mappings; a future contributor-facing view must resolve them. Rate limiting and storage retention need operational policy before public use.

**Public launch is blocked:** editing out sensitive text leaves it in public history. Hiding an entry conceals its history, but restoring the entry republishes every snapshot. Immutable triggers prevent selective deletion or alteration of snapshots; a separately reviewed redaction feature is required before launch.
